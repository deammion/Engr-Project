## 1. Introduction

Web applications are accessed and used by everyone everywhere. Therefore, ensuring web application security is extremely important, yet it is becoming increasingly difficult. There are many vulnerabilities to which web applications are susceptible. The number of potential vulnerabilities makes safeguarding against any exploitation of vulnerabilities very difficult. The exploitation of a single vulnerability may result in an entire website or user account being compromised.   

XSS is one of the most common vulnerabilities which occurs whenever a web application trusts or does not validate untrusted data. [1]. An XSS vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute scripts in an end user’s browser, access a user’s cookies, and could even result in an attacker compromising a user’s account [1]. Furthermore, an XSS attack can have huge consequences, so implementing appropriate security measures is vital.

One way to mitigate the XSS attacks is to use CSP [2]. CSP is an added layer of security that can help protect against different attacks. CSP nonce tags are used to prevent XSS [3]. A nonce is a pseudo-random value intended for one-time use, meaning the nonce changes with each HTTP request [4]. This single-use is to ensure an attacker cannot obtain the value of the nonce. If an application contains script tags in the HTTP response, the nonce value is added as a tag to any trusted script tags within the application. Once the application is run, only script tags with the correct nonce tag and value will be executed [4]. This tagging ensures that only trusted script tags are allowed to be executed within an application. 

This project will use CSP headers and nonce tags to determine whether script tags should be run on a web application to mitigate XSS attacks.

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a working prototype of a proxy plugin program. This program will be capable of reading, interpreting, and analyzing HTTP source code, with the intended purpose of preventing XSS from using CSP nonce tags.

### 1.2 Scope

After meeting with the client, Redshield, and having them read the project requirements, some minor changes have been noted. These changes are based more on clarification of functionality rather than changing the required functionality of the project. These changes will have little to no effect on the project moving forward.<br>

### 1.3 Change to Requirements

The most substantial change is the clarification of the phases of the program’s functionality. Initially, the project team had stated that there were two phases: a collections phase and an operational phase. In the initial report, the collection phase was responsible for collecting HTML responses from the website owners’ server and analysing these responses for script tags. <br>

This phase has been split into two distinct phases: collection and analysis. The collection phase, in this scenario, is still responsible for the collection and storage of the HTML responses. However, the analysis phase will be responsible for parsing, analysing, and updating the percentages relative to the perceived safety of the script tags within the HTML. <br>

The operational phase will operate as described in the project requirements documents. This operation being parsing the HTML responses, checking the percentages of found script tags, and applying nonce tags to the scripts deemed as safe. <br>

This distinction does not change how the proxy plugin operates but rather clarifies collection and analysis. As noted by the client, the ideal outcome of the proxy plugin would be to have all three phases operating simultaneously. Meaning the plugin will continue to update the relative percentages during the operational phase. <br>

By having these three phases operating as an independent process, the plugin could function in this manner. This does not affect the website user or the website owner, as the plugin will still operate in the same manner. The website user will still have no interaction with the plugin unless entering an invalid script tag. The client will still implement the plugin in the same manner by first initiating the proxy in collection mode, where it will collect HTML responses and analyse said responses to get a baseline percentage of included scripts. Then, the plugin will be switched to the operational mode where the program will continue to analyse HTML responses and, in addition, apply nonce tags to ‘safe’ script tags. Essentially, this distinction allows for greater functionality of the plugin. <br>

Another change is to the extension of the program to include a different definition regarding what is considered a ‘safe’ script tag. <br>

In the initial project requirements, it was stated that:
* For the MVP, any script tag found in the collection phase would be deemed safe.
* For the extended functionality, a script tag having a low occurrence would be deemed as unsafe. 

However, after a discussion with the client, it has been decided that a more optimal way to carry out the extension of the project is to determine whether the occurrence of a script is greater than a precalculated amount. This change will also mean that if an unsafe script tag has been entered into a website during the collection phase, we can account for this and still prevent the script tag from being executed. <br>

The last change is implementing a ‘whitelist’ of ‘safe’ scripts regardless of context, such as google analytics, as these can be regarded as safe regardless of their occurrence. By utilising this approach, the plugin can process HTML responses with more efficiency. <br>

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 Stakeholders

Concerns relevant to stakeholders include the portability of the solution to Elixir, potential privacy laws, and licensing requirements. Less technical requirements are reducing or removing workflow interruptions and preserving ease of use through development. Minimising the attack surface, preserving the confidentiality, integrity, availability of data are also concerns.  Finally, there is the language requirement (Python) and the final delivery of the product to the client. Suitability, feasibility, maintainability, and risk factor into each concern.

|                               | Attack Surface: Additional attack surface is a concern as it is counter-productive to the fundamental purpose of the product: Reducing the potential for attacks.                                                                                     | Fair - The vulnerable attack surface as a whole should decrease through the removal of unsafe scripts. Secure coding practices will help minimise the possibility of introducing additional attack vectors.                                                                                         | Low - Fair - Entirely eliminating security vulnerabilities is exceedingly difficult. Following proper practice can help minimise risk but cannot guarantee the absence of vulnerabilities.                                                                                               | High - There are significant opportunities to introduce security vulnerabilities and increase the attack surface area.                                                                                                                                 | Fair - The threat landscape is constantly evolving; changes, hotfixes, and patches will almost certainly be required. Maintainability may be difficult because of the requirements for future security.  |
|                               | Data Confidentiality: Confidentiality is essential for the program. Our use of MITM proxy allows for the use of HTTPS without disrupting the application’s ability to function. MITM proxy also requires SSL Certificates for the client machine running it to be able to establish a connection with an origin server.                                                                         | High - MITM proxy can handle HTTPS connections guaranteeing the same level of confidentiality that would typically be expected for browsing the web. The SSL would normally introduce risk to the confidentiality of data, but due to RedShield's architecture, the SSL of customer websites will not be used directly with the proxy.                                                                                                                                                 | Fair - Implementing an unfamiliar product may have issues that were not expected. Python is explicitly supported through their API, which will make integration easier.                                                                                                                 | Low - MITM proxy is open source, widely used and well tested. Security vulnerabilities are likely to be discovered and fixed very quickly.                                                                                                              | High - As MITM proxy is highly prevalent and open source, it is likely to remain supported for the foreseeable future. The codebase is publicly available, improving the ease of maintenance.             |
|                               | Data Integrity: As this project is likely to be used in secure environments, preserving data integrity is crucial. However, to function as needed, the program must add nonce tags and CSP headers.                                                                  | Fair - High - Typically, no changes will need to be made (except for the addition of nonce tags and CSP headers) as the collection phase should correctly identify most scripts. In the event of a script being prevented from execution, a warning will appear in the browser. MITM proxy will secure data in transit. | Fair - There are no additional barriers of significance to the implementation, as this is a core function of our program and primarily handled by MITM proxy.                                                                                                                            | Low - MITM proxy and HTTPS will ensure integrity in transit, and script tagging will not compromise data integrity, without the user’s notice as they will receive a notification in their browser.                                                       | High - Fair - There are no significant barriers to maintainability in the foreseeable future. The program’s dependency on MITM proxy may prove to be a point of failure.                                  |
|                               | Stability/Reliability: Uptime and reliability are both availability concerns for users. For RedShield to ensure availability, the program produced must be stable and able to fail securely (as per “Project Requirements” - 4.5).                        | High - The solution produced will ultimately be ported to Elixir, which is highly suitable for critical infrastructure. Fail-secure means any issues the program faces will default to a safe state.                                                                                                | High - RedShield will handle porting to Elixir (see Portability), and implementing fail-secure is not problematic.                                                                                                                                                                      | Low - Fail-secure by nature is low risk as the system will default to protecting the user.                                                                                                                                                             | High - (see RedShield:  Maintainer - Portability)                                                                                                                                                        |

Accurately classifying scripts is the critical function of the program; doing this from frequency alone may be difficult.   | Fair - High - Non-delivery of the minimum viable product is low risk.

|                               | Ease of use: The program should require the absolute minimum interaction from end-users in order to be suitable for a customer. This minimisation serves to both preserve productivity and remove the possibility of user error.                      | High - The end-user will have no exposure to the system, with the exception of occasional browser notifications when a script tag is prevented from being executed.                                                                                                                                            | High - The system is designed so that all configuration can be done automatically during the collection phase; No interaction is required from the end-user.                                                                                                                            | Low - Interaction from the user is not required to configure the system, and the exclusion of user interaction introduces no additional risk.                                                                                                          | High - This system is highly maintainable as changes to the system will not affect the end user’s workflow.

**Development:** The development viewpoint illustrates the system from a developer's perspective and involves the software management of the project.   

**Process:** The process viewpoint involves the system processes and how they communicate and run. This view addresses the concurrency, distribution, integrator, performance, and scalability of the project.

**Physical:** The physical viewpoint involves the topology of software components on the physical layer and the physical connections between these components. 

**Scenarios:** The scenario viewpoint describes the architecture of the system through use cases. 

**Circuit Architecture:** The circuit architecture viewpoint involves any circuitry involved with the project. Since this is a software project, there will be no circuitry involved.  

**Hardware Architecture:** The hardware architecture viewpoint involves any hardware involved with the project. Since this is a software project, there will be no hardware involved. 

## 4. Architectural Views

### 4.1 Logical
The proxy will be designed and function independently, without any interaction or input from the website user. The website owner will also have limited interactions with the proxy. If the project is made open-source, the website owners only interactions with the proxy plugin will be switching between phases. If the program is not made open-source, then the client, Redshield, will be handling this implementation. <br>

The diagram below shows the logical interactions of the proxy. It shows how each phase, collection, analysis, and operational, all act independently from each other, and how they function relative to the end-user, depending on what stage the proxy is set to. <br>

As stated above, the proxy's three phases all operate independently from each other. The diagram below shows how the proxy operates relative to what phase it is in, and the logical flow of how the proxy will operate depending on certain conditions. <br>
The red circles are start and end conditions. The blue diamonds are branching decisions and the green boxes are conditional responses depending on those decisions. The white squares occur regardless of any decisions. <br> 

![State Diagram](State_Diagram.jpg)

Following this logic, using the example of a normal use of the website i.e., no attempted XSS attack, the website user will send a HTTP request through the proxy to the host website. The host website will send a HTTP response back through the proxy. <br>
 * During the collection phase, the proxy will: capture the HTTP response (1). Then store and parse the HTML response (3). Then send the HTTP response to the website user (13).<br>
 * During the operational phase, the proxy will: capture the HTTP response (1). Parse the HTML response and check for script tags (4). The proxy will then check all the found script tags and check them against their percentage, determined by the analysis phase (5). The proxy will identify all the script tags as safe (due to their high percentage) and apply nonce tags to all these scripts (6). The HTML will then have the CSP applied (10) and the whole HTTP response will be sent to the website user (13).<br>
 * During both phases, the analysis phase will run. The proxy will capture the HTTP response (1). Then regardless of collection or operational decision (3 or 4), the proxy will analyse the script tags that were found during the collection or operational phases (11). These scripts will then have their percentages updated (occurrence/per page access) (12).<br>
<br>
Using the example of an attempted XSS attack, the website user will send the HTTP request with the XSS embedded in it. The proxy will forward it to the host website. The host website will send the HTTP response. From here:<br>

 * During the collection phase, the proxy will follow the same path as if it were normal access to the website i.e., 1, 3, 13.<br>
 * During the operational phase, the proxy will: capture the HTTP response (1). Parse the HTML response and check for script tags (4). The proxy will then check all the found script tags and check them against their percentage determined by the analysis phase. Since there is an unknown or malicious script, the proxy will identify this script as having a low percentage (5). The script will remain in the HTML, but a nonce tag will not be applied to it. Thus, it will not be executed by the browser (7). The browser will trigger a warning (when the HTTP is returned to the website user) (8). The browser will also report the script to report-uri.com (9). All other scripts found (assuming they have a high percentage) will have nonce tags applied to them (6). The HTML, with the unedited malicious script and the edited safe scripts, will have CSP added to it (10) and then be sent to the website user (13). <br>
 * Similarly to the previous example, the analysis phase will operate during both these phases. It will still analyse the scripts found in the HTML (11) and update their percentages (12). The malicious script will be analysed and have a percentage assigned to it. However, due to its low percentage, the program will still deem it as unsafe due to a low percentage.<br> 

Some further simplified examples of how this diagram shows the process of the program are described below:

Scenario 1:
* A user requests a website that is in the collection phase. The proxy forwards the response from the website to the user and goes through the following stages of the above diagram: <br>

    **1** -> **2** (the website is in the collection phase) -> **3** -> **11** -> **12** -> **13**

Scenario 2:
* A user requests a website that is in the operational phase. The proxy forwards the response from the website to the user and this response contains a script tag that has never been seen before. The program goes through the following stages of the above diagram: <br>

    **1** -> **2** (the website is in the operational phase) -> **4** -> **5** (the script tag hasn't been seen before so the percentage is low) -> **7** -> **8** -> **9**-> **10** -> **13**

### 4.2 Development

![Development Diagram](developmentView.PNG)

The diagram above represents the relationship between the ProxyPlugin code that is stored on GitLab, the FileStore, and the Server which contains the website. <br>

Within the ProxyPlugin the Collection and Operational Python files have a tandem relationship with the proxy. For the proxy to function correctly, both the collection and operational files must provide the correct information. The information gathered by the collection and operational files must be readable such that the proxy can complete its functions on them. Additionally, collection and operational both reply on analysis. <br>

The FileStore contains the HTML responses and script data that was generated by the analysis of the collection and operational code. Once the HTTP response captured by the ProxyPlugin is processed, it is passed into the FileStore and sent to the end-user.

Most, if not all, of the development process, is managed entirely by GitLab. GitLab will therefore be the solution to version control as it can log commits allowing for the prevention of loss of work. One of the risks that we identified was the loss of work and data, whether from deletion or from being overridden. This loss was observed to be prevented by backing up the code on GitLab to be reverted when needed.<br>

The master branch will always have a functioning version, and separate branches will be created for development. The use of branches will ensure that the functional code in the master is not overwritten. The separate branches can be merged into master through the use of a merge request. The merge requests functionality can be used to ensure functional code is committed to the master. This branch management provides us with the ability to review all code before merging into the master branch. The approval process requires at least two members to approve the code before merging into the master branch.<br>

The Issues feature in GitLab allows management of specific parts of the project that need to be completed or have been completed. It allows the team to manage the workload and ensures a fair distribution of the workload. Issues can be assigned to team members to prevent overlaps of work. The use of this tool will assist with time management and development progress.


### 4.3 Process
The process viewpoints outline the operations that take place when the system is run on a webserver. It shows how all entities in an HTTP connection interact with the proxy during the different phases of its life cycle. 

The following sequence model diagram is set up to outline the phase execution order. The user trying to connect to a webpage with the proxy installed is shown on the left of the diagram along with the other entities of the HTTP connection. The arrows between the entities and the user show when they interact with each other. A definition that explains what is happening during the interaction is also included.

![Sequence Diagram](sequenceDiagram.png)

### 4.4 Physical 

This project is solely software-based. Therefore there are no physical requirements that have to be considered. The only requirement outlined for this project is that there must be access to a computer to run the proxy program. Furthermore, the computer must be able to run Python code of version 3.0 or higher. The physical viewpoint outlines how the software deals with the system's hardware availability, reliability, performance, and scalability. Because the project is entirely software-based, there are no physical concerns to be considered.

It is essential to note that this project is part of a more extensive system that includes hardware components and interactions with hardware components. For this software project, there may be hardware concerns when dealing with the larger system in terms of how the software interacts and incorporates with the hardware. The interaction between functions will occur on local disk storage. During the collection and analysis phase, data will be both sent and stored. This is a hardware concern that might be considered when the software interacts with hardware. This is not a direct concern of this software project but it may need to be considered when working with larger systems.

![Deployment Diagram](Deploy.png)


### 4.5 Scenarios

The proxy plug-in program has different scenarios depending on the phase in which the website is in. The diagram below outlines a broad overview of the proxy program and how it works. The user sends a HTTP request to the website, which gets intercepted and forwarded to the website by the proxy program. The website then sends a response back to the user, which also gets intercepted by the proxy program.

![Proxy Scenario Diagram](proxyScenario.PNG)

The two most important scenarios for our MVP are:

* The website can run in the collection phase, with no disruptions to the user, and collect the HTML response of the website. The use cases for the collection phase are shown below.

![Collection Diagram](collectionUseCases.PNG)

* The website can run in the operation phase, with no disruptions unless an unsafe script tag has been entered into the site. The use cases for the operational phase are shown below.

![Operational Diagram](operationalUseCases.PNG)

Each time the website is accessed in both cases, information about each script tag within the page is stored and updated. The analysis phase will be utilised to do this. The use cases for the analysis phase are shown below.

### 5.4 Health and Safety

**Occupational Overuse**
Occupational overuse is a type of overuse injury that may result in Muscle pains, hot or cold flushes, numbness, or a restricted range of movement. Team members will be encouraged to take regular breaks away from their work and personal devices to prevent occupation overuse from occurring. Furthermore, realistic deadlines and workloads will be set to discourage overworking, alongside getting the team to practice good time management to prevent individual overuse as an effort to meet deadlines.
Additionally, team members will have ergonomic workspaces so that any required equipment will be nearby and easily accessible. This will also encompass ensuring desks are at the correct height to encourage correct posture and reduce straining. Correct postures will be promoted and ensured for all team members, and the team will use comfortable chairs, which, if possible, will have back support. This will reduce straining and incorrect postures in a work environment, mitigating occupational overuse and its potential symptoms.

**Eye Strain**
Eye strain occurs when a person has been staring at a computer for long periods without having any breaks away from technology. Insufficient lighting and screen flickering can also contribute to eye strain. As with the Occupational Overuse, the team will be encouraged to take regular breaks away from their work and personal devices. The team will also be encouraged to work in environments with a sufficient lighting level, for example, not working in the dark with the screen as the only light. The team will also make sure that text displayed in any of the work produced is easily readable to avoid eye strain from reading small text.

**Electrical Safety**
Since we are dealing with technology, there is the risk of receiving electrical shocks from any appliances used in the process of working on this project. Electrical safety could pose a small risk to the health of team members when they are dealing with electrical appliances such as laptops, desktop computers, monitors, electrical jugs, and the associated cables for these appliances.  As per the AS/NZS 3760 Standard, to minimise the risk of any electrical shocks, the team should be encouraged to only use appliances which have been through the Test and Tag process in the last 12 months.

**Cable Management**
Unmanaged cables are a safety risk as team members or nearby people can get caught on them or trip on them. To manage this risk, all team members will ensure that any cables they use will be kept underneath their desk, mitigating the possibility of someone getting caught on them. Furthermore, all cables which are not being used will be stored away in a cupboard or bag to mitigate further the risk unmanaged cables pose.

**COVID-19 Outbreak or Lockdown**
To manage the safety risk of another Covid-19 outbreak or lockdown, team members will ensure all work is saved online using Gitlab, so access to the University labs is not mandatory. Furthermore, everyone involved in the project will ensure they have a way to contact each other online. Online contact methods will ensure all members of the team can work from home. This will mitigate this safety risk as it ensures that if there was a Covid-19 outbreak or lockdown, members do not need to expose themselves to any additional Covid-19 risks to do this project.

**Natural Disaster**
To manage the safety risk of earthquakes, cyclones, or tsunamis, team members will ensure that they each have an understanding of the fundamental Natural Disaster responses that should be carried out in the event of any of the above mentioned natural disasters so that our team maximises their chances of getting through the disasters without injury. This basic knowledge should include what to do in the initial stage of a natural disaster, where to go, and what to do after a natural disaster has occurred.

**Health and Safety at External Workplaces**
The project does not require any work or testing to be held off-campus. However, there is a possibility that some meetings will be held at RedShield's office. To receive a Health and Safety induction for this external workplace, team members will contact the client to arrange this before any work being done at the clients' office.

**Human or Animal Test Subjects**

This project does not include any human or animal subjects. This is because all testing can and will be done by the team, using different web applications.

#### 5.4.1 Safety Plans

The project does not involve risk of death, serious harm, harm or injury.

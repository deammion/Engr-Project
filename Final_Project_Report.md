# Final Project Report

**Project _Name_:** Shield all the things<br>
**Client:** Kirk Jackson<br>
**Date:** 18 October 2021<br>

_This is not expected to be a long report and volume will not be rewarded! The purpose of the final report is to summarise and document anything within your project and other documentation that is tacit or implicit, and any assumptions or motivations which can't_ easily _be found elsewhere in your hand-over documentation. If you wish to follow the form of the example final report in the textbook, then you are welcome to do so. **This is primarily a client-facing document.**_

_All text in italics in this template should be replaced by your answers (in regular font). This introductory paragraph should be deleted._

## Project Objective(s)
Create a plugin for MITMproxy in python to collect, process, analyse and categorise scripts on a webpage to allow for the filtering of unsafe scripts. Filtering will be achieved through the use of CSP headers and Nonce Tags. Filtered/Blocked scripts should be blocked from execution and reported through report-uri.

## Summary of Project Results

Full functionality achieved as per the objective stated above. The system is capable of watching traffic and collecting scripts as they pass through the plugin, then analysing them to learn which are common and/or safe before applying this information to assign nonces and block unsafe scripts. Blocked scripts are reported as per the objective.

## Original and Delivered Scope

_The things that are within scope of the delivered project; the things that the delivered project can do. This should convey to the reader those aspects of the project results which are not obvious from other documents. If the project has a significant Issue backlog on delivery, a summary of the pending features, why these features were not completed and how they could be picked up by others if project work was to resume._

## Original and Actual Schedule

_A summary of the original timelines and a summary of deviations from the original plan. This should convey to the reader those aspects of the project results which are not obvious from other documents._

## Delivered Expenditure

No expenditure

## Project Self-Assessment

_A short statement of the teamâ€™s assessment of the delivered project, with a focus on the technical aspects. This should convey to the reader those aspects of the project results which are not obvious from other documents._

## Lessons Learned

_Lessons learned which are of significance, impact and priority to the client. The focus here is on the lessons-learned at the intersection of the technical and management aspects of your project which are relevant to the client. Projects which have encountered significant technical or non-technical issues which will be of particular relevance to the client or the client's organisation should document these in this section._
